  * Fixed to-do enml cleanup

  * Show/Hide is now simplified to "Show" as previously it could lead to inconsistent behaviour
  * Sys Tray menu functionality cleanup
  * New feature search and index without [diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic). This is highly
    useful for some eastern european languages. As this requires reindexing whole database, activation currently
    needs to be done manually (I'll write later some Howto)

  * PDF export improvements
    * fixed: PDF export file picker stays in background after first PDF export.. then stays hidden=>confusing

NixNote (2.1.0-alfa8) unstable; urgency=low
  * Added **docker build**. Creating binaries ouf of source is now very straightforward.
  * Improved reporting and logging of errors (mainly for sync errors). The messages may be now
    more technical (can be improved later), but should at least display always and more
    details are in log.
 -- Robert Spiegel <nightingale7@gmail.com>  Fri, 06 Jul 2018 12:00:00 -0400

NixNote (2.1.0-alfa7) unstable; urgency=low
  * **Redesigned html cleanup** to prevent sync errors. Now newest html tidy libray is used (currently v.5.6).
    Before system level tidy executable was used, which could be like 9 years old.
    Pasting ~any html content into note should work now. Although sometimes images are not recognised.
    Images need to be attached manually (e.g. by drag & drop.)
  * Improved exception handling and logging. Removed log level setting in gui. Log level may now be set
    from command line using e.g. --logLevel=1 for debug level.
  * Changed some setting defaults - e.g. which columns are initially shown (default "title" only).
    Settings can be changed in preferences and are preserved on next run (same as before).
 -- Robert Spiegel <nightingale7@gmail.com>  Fri, 06 Jul 2018 12:00:00 -0400

NixNote (2.1.0-alfa6) unstable; urgency=low
  * [AppImage packaging](https://appimage.org/) using [linuxdeployqt](https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt).
    This should allow easy deployment "anywhere" no worry about missing dependencies
    and later use newest libraries.
  * Focus on search box after "all notes"
  * **Title column in note table view now display compound information** - Title + sync needed + relevance hint.
    (Sync is signalized by triangle at begin, if the note is found "more relevant" in search its displaed
    bold). May be later made configurable.
    Main aim is to be able to hide all other columns. Sorting is relevance+date update - so you may
    just display title column & hide all others. See: [compound title preview](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/62lnikzyf4r0sa2/AADMk-EHBwvBt7G5bOga9tyia?dl=0&preview=RS-6-compound-title.png)
  * Removed function of opening notes in new tabs - doesn't work stable and is only confusing. Could be
    re-added back later (commit id 6149a745d014f55352b2e6cad8ff4637414861b7).
  * Improved logging in case there is problem with resources (and note is set to read only in nixnote).

  * Minor improvement in font color/background color (highlight selection).
    Tooltip now shows how to use. Keyboard shortcuts possible (default Ctrl-d, Ctrl-Shift-H). Context
    menu option added. Color buttons will preserve state across program restart.
  * Tooltips with kbd shortcut info for all editor and main toolbar icons added.
  * Few more default kbd shortcuts added.
  * Remove hardcoded build in kbd shortcuts (now all comes from shortcuts.ini)
  * Changed theme handling - now all themes come from ini file (incl. of the Default theme). This is
    similar to shortcuts.txt.
  * Clear search text, after click on "All notes".
  * Restructured main toolbar.
  * Renamed theme.ini to themes.ini because of structure changes prevent loading of legacy user themes
    (they will need minor fixes to work with new version). To make things easier, now all CSS is inline.
    Loading from file my be reintroduced later.
 -- Robert Spiegel <nightingale7@gmail.com>  Mon, 02 Jul 2018 12:00:00 -0400
